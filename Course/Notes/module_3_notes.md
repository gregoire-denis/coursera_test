### Rules and basic idead for Clients 

Most clients have no idead what they want : ask the right questions to help the client figure it's needs
Bring website examples of similar businesses, and have the client react to the features

Clients will want to add a LOT of information to the website. 
Encourage them to hierarchise their information correctly, and cut what isn't crucial

Find a way for the client to invest in the project and have him designate ONE person responsable for decisions

Have a limited number of free revisions, contracted if possible. 

### Design overview 

In this module our client is a kosher chinese restaurant.

DONT START CODING RIGHT AWAY !!! Make some layout mockups, present to the client, and once approved, we can start coding.

We will use **balsamiq** mockup tool to create these mockups.

In our first mockup, we lay it out as such : 

We have a header which contains the logo of the restaurant, it's name, and on the right side a row of menu buttons, and a phone number 
Then we have a large blank space, reserved for a picture of the restaurant's dining room. This is called a **jumbotron** in boostrap.
Underneath the jumbotron, we have three large interactible squares : Menu, Specials, and a Map. 
The footer contains the hours, a client quote and the adress of the restaurant. 

We then make a mockup for tablets : 
Not much changes, we're just going to squeeze some items

When we jump to mobile, it looks very different : 
We loose the menu row on the top right in favor of a grouped menu button, which collapses into our row, turned into a column.
We move the telephone number in the middle of the page (horizontally), right underneath the name and logo of the restaurant. This is because the user most likely wants the phone number just a click away. 
The jumbotron will be much smaller, so that the mobile can load the image reasonably fast.
The bottom row has changed as well : 
We still have our Menu and Special buttons (because these are paramount to the user experience), but we embedded a map directly underneath, without need to request it.
The footer remains.

Now that the home page is done, we have to design the Menus page : 
The header will remain consistent across our website, so it stays the same. 
We have several boxes which will contain all the different menus the restaurant has to offer. 
We then design the menu's lists : once the user has interacted with one of the menus, we want to layout a list of items this menu has to offer. 
Hence we layout rows of rectangular images, with the name of the item and it's description floating to the right of it. 
We use a textual ID for every menu item. In this instance, this is provided by the actual restaurant's menu. 

Now our designer can provide actual design mockups, which will most likely contain stock photography, and hexadecimal values for the colors being used, as well as which specific fonts have been used .
